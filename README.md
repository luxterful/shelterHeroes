# Shelter Heroes Platform

A social media platform for shelters and their animals.

> ### Make a difference!
>
> There are thousands of animals living in shelters right now. You can be the difference in their lives. You can support our little four legged friends not only with an adoption, but also with a donation or simply by being their companion. Beyond that you can show off the cutest, funniest and quirkiest moments in the life of your own little furball to the world. Connect with the pet friends around you, arrange playdates, meet up for adventure. Be the difference.
